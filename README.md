# Usage

You can use KrunkerToWavefront to create .obj files from your Krunker.io maps (although lots of things may be excluded). You can then do whatever you want to them, like use them in your own games or render them in Blender. To actually use KrunkerToWavefront you need to install Node.js. After that you can invoke it through the command line as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CobaltXII/KrunkerToWavefront.git
cd KrunkerToWavefront/
node krunkerToWavefront.js
```

You will then get .obj and .mtl files for the 5 default maps. To do this to your own maps, use these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CobaltXII/KrunkerToWavefront.git
cd KrunkerToWavefront/
node krunkerToWavefront.js <PATH_TO_YOUR_MAP>
```

You will then get .obj and .mtl files for the given map.
