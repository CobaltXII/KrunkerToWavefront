# Features

Currently, KrunkerToWavefront supports the following features
- .obj conversion of cubes
- .obj conversion of planes
- .obj conversion of ramps
- .obj conversion of water
- .obj conversion of models
- .obj conversion of rotated objects
- .mtl conversion of diffuse materials
- .mtl conversion of emissive materials
- .mtl conversion of opacity
- .mtl conversion of textured models

In the future, I would like to add support for the following features
- .obj conversion of ladders
- .obj conversion of billboards
- .mtl conversion of textured materials

# Usage

You can use KrunkerToWavefront to create .obj files from your Krunker.io maps. You can then do whatever you want to them, like use them in your own games or render them in Blender. To actually use KrunkerToWavefront you need to install Node.js. After that you can invoke it through the command line as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CobaltXII/KrunkerToWavefront.git
cd KrunkerToWavefront/
node krunkerToWavefront.js
```

You will then get .obj and .mtl files for the 5 default maps, which can be found in the wavefront/ directory. To do this to your own maps, use these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CobaltXII/KrunkerToWavefront.git
cd KrunkerToWavefront/
node krunkerToWavefront.js <map>
```

You will then get .obj and .mtl files for the given map, which can be found in the wavefront/ directory.
